# Disaster Response Pipeline Project (Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree)

## Project
This project is part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in collaboration with Figure Eight. In this project, the pre-labeled disaster messages will be used to build a disaster response model that can categorize messages received in real time during a disaster event, so that messages can be sent to the right disaster response agency.

This project includes a web application where disaster response worker can input messages received and get classification results.
